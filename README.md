# üõ°Ô∏è CTF Walkthroughs by Sakina Kerubo Opanga

This repository complements my [Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio](https://sakina-opanga.my.canva.site/cybersecurity-analyst-portfolio-website), where I document hands-on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges focused on ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and adversarial thinking.

Each walkthrough reflects my approach to:
- Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities across web, network, and system targets
- Practicing privilege escalation and post-exploitation techniques
- Documenting findings with clarity, precision, and ethical framing

## üîç Featured Challenges
The CTFs highlighted in my portfolio include:
- **Webcam phishing simulation** using CamPhish and Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Network reconnaissance and exploitation** with Bettercap, Nmap, ffuf, and gobuster
- **Privilege escalation and password cracking** from Moringa School CTF finals
- **Enumeration and reporting** across 80+ TryHackMe labs

## üéØ Purpose
This space serves as a technical archive and ethical showcase of my cybersecurity journey. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning, responsible conduct, and minimalist documentation.

## üìú Disclaimer
All simulations were conducted in controlled environments for educational purposes only. I do not support or condone unauthorized access or malicious activity.
