üé• Webcam Phishing Simulation Using CamPhish (Cloudflare Tunnel)
üß† Objective
To ethically simulate a webcam phishing attack using CamPhish, a social engineering tool that exploits browser-based camera permissions. This lab was conducted in a controlled environment to demonstrate how attackers might gain unauthorized access and to reinforce defensive awareness.
________________________________________
üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used
CamPhish ‚Äî A phishing toolkit that creates fake web pages requesting webcam access. Once permission is granted, it captures snapshots from the target‚Äôs webcam. It uses:
‚Ä¢	PHP for page rendering
‚Ä¢	Cloudflare Tunnel for secure public URL exposure
‚Ä¢	Browser permission prompts to initiate camera access

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Execution
1. Environment Preparation
‚Ä¢	OS: Kali Linux
‚Ä¢	Dependencies: Git, PHP, Cloudflare Tunnel
git clone https://github.com/techchipnet/CamPhish.git  
cd CamPhish  
bash camphish.sh

CamPhish initialized with Cloudflare tunneling option.

2. Phishing Link Generation
‚Ä¢	Selected Cloudflare Tunnel for stable public URL exposure
‚Ä¢	CamPhish generated a phishing link mimicking a verification or login page

Phishing link generated via Cloudflare Tunnel for webcam access simulation.

3. Simulated Victim Interaction
‚Ä¢	Shared the link with a consented lab subject
‚Ä¢	Subject clicked the link and granted webcam access
‚Ä¢	CamPhish captured snapshots and stored them locally

 Simulated phishing page requesting webcam access.

Snapshots stored in CamPhish output folder.
________________________________________
üîç Observations
‚Ä¢	The phishing page was visually convincing
‚Ä¢	Browser permission prompts were present but easily overlooked
‚Ä¢	Snapshots were only captured after explicit permission‚Äîhighlighting user awareness as a key defense
________________________________________
üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Boundaries
This demonstration was conducted in a controlled lab environment with full consent. No real-world exploitation occurred. The purpose was to:
‚Ä¢	Understand attacker tactics
‚Ä¢	Educate users on phishing risks
‚Ä¢	Reinforce ethical hacking principles
________________________________________
üß© Mitigation Strategies
‚Ä¢	Inspect URLs before clicking
‚Ä¢	Deny unnecessary camera/microphone permissions
‚Ä¢	Use browser extensions like uBlock Origin or NoScript
‚Ä¢	Educate users on social engineering tactics

üìò Reflection
This exercise sharpened my understanding of phishing mechanics and the psychology behind permission-based attacks. It also reinforced the importance of ethical hacking in exposing vulnerabilities before they‚Äôre exploited maliciously.
